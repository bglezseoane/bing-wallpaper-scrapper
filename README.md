Bing.com wallpaper scrapper
===========================

## Information

This is a scrapper to download the latest picture of the day from Bing.com and saves it to a directory. This program is an adaptation from Alejandro Figueroa's [`bing-wallpaper`](https://github.com/thejandroman/bing-wallpaper) with the main difference that in this case the wallpaper configuration in the user machine is out of scope. This is only to scrap the wallpaper.

This fork also fix some problems detected with [`bing-wallpaper`](https://github.com/thejandroman/bing-wallpaper).
